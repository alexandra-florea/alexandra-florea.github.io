title: "Minimally Viable, what does it mean for me"

For me it means chosing what to focus on and knowing when to stop, enjoy the little wins, take a break, and leave the project in a better shape than you found it. So that you have what to come back to in a couple of days, a week, or even a month.

But let's back up a little. According to [Technopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27809/minimum-viable-product-mvp)
> A minimum viable product (MVP) is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed after considering feedback from the product's initial users.

So, when it comes to this website for instance, I'm considering it minimally viable today as a playground for chasing ideas, organising thought, and focusing my attention. For starters, by recording weekly logs of sorts, and keeping a somewhat lose track of the things I do and learn from.

And then there's the long list of improvements that I can roll out slowly in the coming months.

Room for improvement:
* fill in every descriptive section of the site with a short, relevant text
* link CV
* link twitter, uni page, tGov
* debug disqus (comment section)
* center the image on the blog page
* allign/resize images inside blog posts

Nice to have:
* a visual CV in Tableau
* navigation between blog posts
* categories/tags for the blog posts
* a hand drawn envelope icon instead of "email" in footer

Not sure about:
* linking social media (twitter, facebook)
* linking tiny letter
