Well. I finally got around it. Putting this little website together was the project I didn't know I needed in my life, but I very much welcome. 

Neat thing about it - is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

The **backbone** of this little website is the _very informative tutorial_ by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). **Logo** made from a combination of [own handwritten font](https://www.calligraphr.com/en/sharing/font_preview/jcEEMdS3iGD/), and a 'books' icon by [Anna Smylie](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=book%20shelf&i=662227), brought together in [canva](https://www.canva.com/). **Fonts** IBM Plex Serif, Oswald, and Roboto, hand-picked from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/selection?selection.family=IBM+Plex+Serif:200%7COswald%7CRoboto:300) after falling in love with [Lubalin Graph](http://www.identifont.com/similar?O8), and then accepting that's . . . not a design choice for now.

Maybe later . . .

After, for instance: eg. I get more hands on experience with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and I'm able to write a blogpost and insert images in it, without a cheatsheet nearby. 

(going to figure out how to insert said image)

LE. _The good news_, here's the image, below; _the ugly news_: it's filling more screens than you have._The bad news_? There's no bad news, I just need to learn another thing or two about keeping it together online (I mean the website.)
