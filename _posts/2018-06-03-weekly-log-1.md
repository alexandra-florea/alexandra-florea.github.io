As it happens, I'm sitting to write this down and it's 15:46 on a Sunday. 

Just about the right time to look back at the week that's about to end, to count the wins (especially the little ones), reflect on recent mistakes ([they say that analyzing past failures may boost future performance by reducing stress](https://blog.frontiersin.org/2018/04/16/neuroscience-better-performance-lower-stress-after-failure/?utm_source=S-FBK&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FNBEH_20180427)), and bookmark whatever is that I might be wanting to get back to at some point.

So, here it goes . . .

**Wins**
* got the hang of using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)
* got a mini-training in [MaxQDA](https://www.maxqda.com/learn-maxqda/maxqda-2018-video-tutorials) and I think it will serve me well moving forward
* made this website
* made a [hand-written font](https://www.calligraphr.com/en/sharing/font_preview/jcEEMdS3iGD/)
* attended an amazing Data Viz webinar by Andy Dirk and got all data dreamy :) [this](http://www.visualisingdata.com/) is his website, and it's great.

**Mistakes**
In some ways, it has been an emotionally difficult week. So to ease it's burden, I immersed myself quite heavily in a number of personal projects. While that's all good and fine, I might have overlooked a deadline or two speeding my way. It's not all tragic, but it's also not the first time *it* happens. (to be continued in paper-based medium...)

**Half-read-books**
* [Why Fonts Matter](https://typetastingnews.com/book/), by Sarah Hyndman
* [Bulshit Jobs](https://g.co/kgs/UyJrMX), by David Graeber ([here's the initial article that inspired the book](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/))

**Bookmarked**
* got really interested in the Sage Campus [course offer](https://campus.sagepub.com/?utm_source=Adestra&utm_medium=email&utm_content=8P0130A&utm_campaign=not+tracked&utm_term=#course-list), especially the [Intro do Data Viz](https://campus.sagepub.com/introduction-to-data-visualisation) starting on the **25th of June**
* started setting up [NodeXL](https://www.smrfoundation.org/nodexl/) on my mac about a week ago (to see how it compares to Gephi in terms of different functionalities), but then the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) wasn't quick enough to activate my account, so the installation remained suspended. In the meantime, my AWS account is up and running, so maybe this is a project for next weekend :) 
* [this application](https://iris.ai/) floored me, as I was just describing it to a friend in great detail just hours before I discovered it was a real thing. I'll most certainly use it extensively for visually exploring and mapping the literature in the initial stages of research projects.
